Write a Java program that simulates the rolling of two six-sided dice.  
Run the simulation 10 times, 100 times, 1000 times, and 10000 times.  
For each run, print the number of times that the two dice ended up as “snake eyes” (i.e., both dice equal to 1).  
Print the results in a table like this (your numbers will vary):
10:  0 snake eyes
100: 2 snake eyes
1000:  28 snake eyes
10000:  312 snake eyes2.

The formula below(an alternating infinite series) can be used to approximate the value of π.  
How many terms of the series are required to get 8 digits of precisionin the estimate of π?  
Write a Java program that finds the number of terms needed to achieve the eight-digit precision. 
Use this formula: π/4 = 1 –1/3 + 1/5 –1/7 + 1/9 -...
